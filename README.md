## Project Description:

This project involves analyzing Brazilâ€™s e-commerce sales data using Power BI to uncover key business insights. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes customer orders, payments, products, and seller details.

## Key Highlights:

âœ… Data Cleaning & Transformation: Processed raw data using Power Query for better usability.

âœ… Data Modeling: Established one-to-many and many-to-one relationships among tables.

âœ… DAX Calculations: Created measures for total sales, profit, order count, and customer preferences.

âœ… Visualizations Used: Donut Chart, Line & Clustered Column Chart, Bar Chart, KPI Cards, and Slicers.
